As part of my deepdive into the world of JavaScript and front end development, I created a Tetris game in React.  The biggest thing I took away from this was learning about hooks and how it's possible to uses state, without having to create a class. 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Installing:

git clone https://github.com/Tacoholic/TetrisReact.git

cd into "TetrisReact" and run

npm install

After that process is completed, you can then enter 

npm start


Enjoy!
